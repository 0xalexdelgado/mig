Interactions between an investigator (a human being) and the MIG platform are
performed through a REST API. The API exposes functions to create actions,
retrieve results, and generally monitor the activity of the agents.

The API follows the core principles of REST, and provides discoverable
endpoints. The document format follows the `Collection+JSON - Hypermedia Type
<http://amundsen.com/media-types/collection/>`_.

Authentication with X-PGPAUTHORIZATION version 1
------------------------------------------------

Authenticating against the MIG API requires sending a PGP signed token in the
request header named `X-PGPAUTHORIZATION`. The key that signs the token must
belong to an active investigator. Construction of the token works as follows:

1. make a string named **str** composed of a version, a UTC timestamp in RFC3339 format
   and a random nonce, each separated by semicolons. The current version is **1**
   and may be upgraded in the future. The nonce value must be a positive integer.

   **str=<VERSION>;<UTC TIMESTAMP RFC3339>;<NONCE>**

   UTC is a hard requirement. The timestamp must end with the suffix **Z**
   which indicates the UTC timezone. In bash, a correct timestamp can be
   generated with the command `$ date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ`.

   An example string would look like: `1;2006-01-02T15:04:05Z;1825922807490630059`

   The string must be terminated by a newline character, hexadecimal code `0x0a`.

.. code:: bash

	$ hexdump -C <<< '1;2006-01-02T15:04:05Z;1825922807490630059'
	00000000  31 3b 32 30 30 36 2d 30  31 2d 30 32 54 31 35 3a  |1;2006-01-02T15:|
	00000010  30 34 3a 30 35 5a 3b 31  38 32 35 39 32 32 38 30  |04:05Z;182592280|
	00000020  37 34 39 30 36 33 30 30  35 39 0a                 |7490630059.|
	0000002b

2. PGP sign **str** with the private key of the investigator. Armor and detach
   the signature into **armoredSig**::

	$ gpg -a --detach-sig <<< '1;2006-01-02T15:04:05Z;1825922807490630059'

	-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----

	=4nrR
	-----END PGP SIGNATURE-----

3. Create **sig** by taking **armoredSig** and removing the PGP headers, footers,
   empty lines and newlines.

	example: `iQEcBAABCAAGBQJUWPDpAAoJEKPWUhc7dj6PQdgH/0TRMOEAL4SL6v+JvixWtEGJzXBCqBpRBsygHAKT+m4AxwniVa9vr8vfWm14eFpZTGdlDx39Ko+tdFoHn5Z1yKEeQWEQYXqhneAnv0pYR1aIjXM8MY63TNePWBZxUerlRkjv2IH16/W5aBrbOctOxEs1BKuN2pd4Hgubr+2f43gcRcWW+Ww/5Fyg1lKzH8jP84uqiIT8wQOdBrwUkgRdSdfMQbYFjsgY57G+ZsMobNhhlFedgKuZShJCd+G1GlwsfZPsZOSLmVZahI7wjR3vckCJ66eff3e/xX7Gt0zGGa5i1dgH5Q6TSjRGRBE37FwD4C6fycUEuy9yKI7iFziw33Y==k6gT`

4. Create **token** by concatenating **str**, a semicolon, and **sig**.
   **token=<str>;<sig>**
   example: `1;2006-01-02T15:04:05Z;1825922807490630059;owEBYQGe/pANAwAIAaPWUhc7dj6...<truncated>`

5. Send **token** in the header named **X-PGPAUTHORIZATION** with the request::

	$ curl -H 'X-PGPAUTHORIZATION: 1;2006-01-02T15:04:05Z;1825922807490630059;owEBYQGe/pANAwAIAaP...<truncated>' localhost:12345/api/v1/

6. The API verifies the version and validity period of the timestamp. By default, a
   token will be rejected if its timestamp deviates from the server time by more
   than 10 minutes. Administrators can configure this value. In effect, this
   means a timestamp is valid for twice the duration of the window. By default,
   that's 10 minutes before current server time, and 10 minutes after current
   server time.

7. If the timestamp is valid, the API next verifies the signature against the data
   and authenticates the user. Failure to verify the signature returns an error
   with the HTTP code 401 Unauthorized.

8. The user is authorized, the API processes and answer the request.

Security implications
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. A token can be used an unlimited number of times within its validity period.
   There is no check to guarantee that a token is only used once. It is
   assumed that the token is transmitted over a secure channel such as HTTPS to
   prevent token theft by a malicious user.

2. API clients and servers must use proper time synchronization for the timestamp
   verification to work. A client or a server that has inaccurate time may not be
   able to establish connections. We believe this requirement to be reasonable
   considering the sensitivity of the API.

Example 1: invalid timestamp
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The signature is valid but the timestamp is beyond the acceptable time window.

.. code:: bash

	$ curl -H 'X-PGPAUTHORIZATION: 1;2006-01-02T15:04:05Z;1825922807490630059;iQEcB...<truncated>' http://localhost:12345/api/v1/

	{
		"collection": {
			"error": {
				"code": "6077873045059431424",
				"message": "Authorization verification failed with error 'verifySignedToken() -> token timestamp is not within acceptable time limits'"
			},
			"href": "http://localhost:12345/api/v1/",
			"template": {},
			"version": "1.0"
		}
	}

Example 2: invalid signature
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The signature is not valid, or is signed by a key that the API does not
recognize.

.. code:: bash

	$ curl -H 'X-PGPAUTHORIZATION: 1;2014-11-04T15:36:05Z;1825922807490630059;iQEcBA...<truncated>' http://localhost:12345/api/v1/

	{
		"collection": {
			"error": {
				"code": "6077875007260332032",
				"message": "Authorization verification failed with error 'verifySignedToken() -> GetFingerprintFromSignature() -> openpgp: invalid signature: hash tag doesn't match'"
			},
			"href": "http://localhost:12345/api/v1/",
			"template": {},
			"version": "1.0"
		}
	}

Generating a token in Bash
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code::

	$ token="1;$(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ);$RANDOM$RANDOM$RANDOM$RANDOM"; \
	sig=$(gpg -a --detach-sig <<< $token |tail -8 |head -7 \
	| sed ':a;N;$!ba;s/\n//g'); echo "X-PGPAUTHORIZATION: $token;$sig"

	X-PGPAUTHORIZATION: 1;2014-11-04T19:13:37Z;13094113753132512760;iQEcBAA.....

`Postgres's documentation
<http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.4/static/functions-matching.html>`_.

Note: URL encoding transform the **%** character into **%25**, its ASCII value.

* Examples:

Generate a compliance report from `compliance` action ran over the last 24
hours. For more information on the `compliance` format, see section 2.

.. code:: bash

List the agents that have sent a heartbeat in the last hour.

.. code:: bash

	/api/v1/search?type=agent&after=2014-05-30T15:00:00-04:00&limit=200

Find actions ran between two dates (limited to 10 results as is the default).

.. code:: bash

	/api/v1/search?type=action&status=sent
	&after=2014-05-01T00:00:00-00:00&before=2014-05-30T00:00:00-00:00

.. code:: bash

	/api/v1/search?investigatorname=%25bob%25smith%25&limit=10&type=command


Data transformation
-------------------
The API implements several data transformation functions between the base
format of `action` and `command`, and reporting formats.

Compliance Items
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The compliance item format is used to measure the compliance of a target with
particular requirement. A single compliance item represent the compliance of
one target (host) with one check (test + value).

In MIG, an `action` can contain compliance checks. An `action` creates one
`command` per `agent`. Upon completion, the agent stores the results in the
`command.results`. To visualize the results of an action, an investigator must
look at the results of each command generated by that action.

To generate compliance items, the API takes the results from commands, and
creates one item per result. Therefore, a single action that creates hundreds of
commands could, in turn, generate thousands of compliance items.

The format for compliance items is simple, to be easily graphed and aggregated.

.. code:: javascript

	{
		"target": "agents.name='server1.prod.example.net'",
		"policy": {
			"level": "medium",
			"name": "system",
			"url": "https://link.to.compliance.reference/index.html"
		},
		"check": {
			"description": "compliance check for openssh",
			"location": "/etc/ssh/sshd_config",
			"name": "check for verbose logging (logs fingerprints)",
			"test": {
				"type": "regex",
				"value": "(?i)^loglevel verbose$"
			}
		},
		"compliance": true,
		"link": "http://localhost:1664/api/v1/command?commandid=6019232265601776819",
		"timestamp": "2014-05-30T14:55:41.907745Z"
	}

When using the parameter `&report=complianceitems`, the `search` endpoint of the API
will generate a list of compliance items from the results of the search.
